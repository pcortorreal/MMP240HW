  <h1>Vintage.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide1.jpg">
  <p>
  Vintage and antique furniture pieces bring a certain feel of sustenance and richness to any home. The Victorian sofa that you inherited from your grandmother or the piece that just caught your eye from the window of an antique shop exhibits a unique type of strength and staying power that no modern piece comes close to.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Home Decor.</h1>

  <p>
  Some experts believe that Victorian style furniture represents elegance and sophistication.  If you prefer the appearance of Victorian style furniture in your home, you may want others to see these qualities in you. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  You may go for authentic antiques or modern reproductions covered in upholstery fabric that brings all the pieces in your home together. Covering an old piece with new jacquard fabric is also a good way to revive a worn piece and maintain the authentic design.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Comfort.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide4.jpg">
  <p>
  When choosing the upholstery fabric for any piece of furniture that you intend to spend any amount of time on, the way it feels, looks, and holds up over time are the most important considerations. The best choice usually depends on how and when the piece of furniture will be used.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  For example, you might choose to use a strong and water resistant outdoor fabric for chairs and sofas in the game room where kids will play and eat snacks, but you aren’t as likely to bring something delicate like satin to the outdoors.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Color.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide5.jpg">
  <p>
  Do you want a bedroom that makes you feel peaceful and helps you go to sleep? Neutrals can make your bedroom restful while also serving as a backdrop for more colorful touches. If you find neutrals too boring, soft grays, blues, greens, and lavender are still good choices that let you surround yourself with refreshing color.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Do you need a colorful bedroom that helps you wake up and get going in the morning? Warm, sunny colors and patterns are the ideal solution for getting your day off to a cheery start.  Look to oranges, yellows, and greens in a variety of patterns to create energy for the best pick-me-up.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Texture.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide6.jpg">
  <p>
  Mixing up texture allows you to create contrast without varying a great deal in color or pattern. For example, a tan bedspread made from shiny jacquard fabric will contrast with a matching headboard made from velvety upholstery fabric. The same is true for fur rugs, woven draperies, lampshades, and any other upholstered furniture and accessories in the room.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Mid-Century Modern.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide7.jpg">
  <p>
  In design, the adage is that “everything old becomes new again.” Since the late 1990s, many designers and creative types have abandoned the “shabby-chic” ethos for 1950s-inspired mid-century modern. The clean lines and simple finishes of mid-century design are functional and beautiful, and now available at almost any price point.
  <br>
  <p>
  Even though most design trends last a few years – see the aforementioned shabby-chic, 1920s Spanish, and art Nouveau – mid-century modern remains popular with designers and consumers alike.   You need only to flip through a home magazine or stroll through a mass retailer like West Elm or CB2, and it’s all variations on the Eames-chair-and-tulip-table theme.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
  Why does mid-century remain so popular?  Its wide appeal makes sense, because it was designed specifically to be lived with, rather than show pieces – it is democratic and made in simple shapes with classic materials – so it seems timeless and goes with everything.  The pieces are beautifully functional and they lend themselves well to smaller spaces and urban environments like city lofts.  Its simplicity is universally understood and appreciated.  Mid-century modern is also uniquely American, so it’s easy to find – both the antique versions and reproductions at modern retailers.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h1>Antique Integration.</h1>
  <img src="Images/slide8.jpg">
  <p>
  Is your antique a piece of furniture?  A wonderful way to work an old, perhaps ornate piece of furniture into a modern home is to pair it with more contemporary pieces.  A primitive antique dining table, or a glossy mahogany one with turned legs, will look equally at home paired with modern seating – metal chairs or ones upholstered in a graphic print.  Flank an antique with newer pieces and it will become a cohesive part of your space.
