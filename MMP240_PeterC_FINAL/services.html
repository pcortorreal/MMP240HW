  <p>
  When you entrust Beckenstein Fabrics to create custom upholstery and slipcovers, you can be confident you’ll receive the world-class service and attention to detail on which we’ve built our reputation. Quality is at the forefront of everything we do—it’s why our upholstery furniture shop in New York City has flourished for nearly a century. Count on us to skillfully recover your furniture with the fabric of your choice, tailoring the look to your style and comfort.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Custom Slipcovers Breathe New Life Into Furniture.</h2>
  <p>
  If the upholstery on your sofa, loveseat, armchair, ottoman, sectional, or other furniture piece looks worn, Beckenstein custom slipcovers are the ideal choice. Slipcovers give your furniture a fresh look now while leaving you with the option of reupholstering later.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Choose from Thousands of Fabric Styles, Colors, and Textures.</h2>
  <p>
  Simply select the fabric of your choice from our extensive catalog, and one of our craftsmen will come to your home to take measurements. Then we’ll get to work crafting custom covers that fit your furniture seamlessly. Don’t scour New York City for slipcovers—count on the experts at Beckenstein. Pick-up and delivery service is available for all upholstery: Call 646.395.3697 or email us at info@beckensteinfabrics.com.
  <br>
  Don’t hesitate to contact us for information about our new filling for cushions and custom furniture, and ask about our upholstery services.

<h1>Headboards Bedding</h1>

<h1>Custom Bedding and Headboards in New York City.</h1>
<br>
<p>
The difference between ready-made bedding and custom bedding is the difference between night and day. With custom bedding, you have full control over the look and feel of your room. Choose from thousands of unique fabrics and trims. Mix and match styles. Coordinate pieces. Want a patterned look? No problem. Prefer a solid color? That’s easy enough. Want to combine patterns and solids? You can do that as well. Do you fancy a fitted bedspread, or are you partial to a loose throw? Once you experience the custom difference, you’ll never buy one-size-fits-all bedding again.
</p>
<p>
Custom made headboards are in high demand. With limited options in stores and a desire for something special, many people turn to fabrication services like ours to get the custom headboard they’ve been looking for. We can help you create the perfect custom headboard, crafted from the beautiful headboard fabrics of your choice, or simply take your ideas and turn them into reality, giving you the custom headboard that you have been dreaming of. Call us or fill out the form on this page when you’re ready to get started on your custom headboard.
</p>
<p>
The right bedding can also transform an ordinary room into a personalized getaway. Select from an exclusive collection of lovely duvet covers and coverlets. If you need help finding the right fabric, trim, or cut, we can help you settle on the perfect look. Click the button below to request a live quote.

<br>
<p>
Transform your outdoor space into a comfortable place to relax, eat, and gather. There’s no reason your backyard deck or rooftop hangout has to be cold and sparse. Use outdoor cushions, lounge chair pillows, and boat cushion upholstery from Beckenstein Fabrics & Interiors to make it warm, inviting, and interesting.
</p>
<p>
Outdoor and indoor fabrics do double duty. They work as well on the patio as they do in the living room. What makes them unique is their resistance to both fading and staining. They also stand tough against mildew brought on by wet conditions. Able to withstand both sun and rain, heat and damp, outdoor cushions and upholstery are perfectly suited for any patio, deck, roof, balcony, or backyard. Give us a call or visit our New York City store, located in the heart of Manhattan, to choose from a wide selection of beautiful and durable fabrics with which to accent your outdoor furniture.
